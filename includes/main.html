			<td class="leftp"> <p>Iridium Labs was formed in the Winter of 2013 by myself and friend
			as a social coding group, and has been many different things depending on who you ask.
			We had the idea to develop software for fun, and free of charge, and share with friends who needed to spend more time focusing on their work. Since then it has become a way to socialize and write code with people from all over the world.</p></td>
			<td class= "rightp"> <p>By having a variety of different skill sets, we've been able to not only write free and open source code to contribute to other projects, but we have also 
			been able to write some of our own unique tools, and be profitable doing so. At the end of the day, it's about keeping computing free, and user friendly for everyone. We specialize in
			desktop, mobile app, and website design in the Manatee, Bradenton, and Sarasota areas of Florida.
